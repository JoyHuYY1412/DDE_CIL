# Instructions
1. Dependencies
	- Python 3.6 (Anaconda3 Recommended)
	- Pytorch 0.4.0

2. Getting Started 
	- the data for CIFAR100 and ImageNet are put in `cifar100-class-incremental/data` and `imagenet-class-incremental/data`, or you can make soft links to the directories which include the corresponding data
	- make soft links for `utils_incremental` folder under `cifar100-class-incremental` and `imagenet-class-incremental`
	- make folders `logs`, `results` and `checkpoint` under `cifar100-class-incremental` and `imagenet-class-incremental`
	- see `cifar100-class-incremental/run.sh` for the experiments on CIFAR100
	- see `imagenet-class-incremental/run.sh` for the experiments on ImageNet-Subset
	- see `imagenet-class-incremental/run_all.sh` for the experiments on ImageNet-Full
